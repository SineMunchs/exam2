         <h1 class ="hanken font-extralight text-xl "> "While in battle I’m free, never free to rest" is an explosion of collective strength. It is magic and unpredictability when 10 street dancers meet 14 classical dancers from the renowned Swedish company Cullberg.
       <br><br>The Iranian-born choreographer Hooman Sharifi has created a very special encounter between dancers – between people – from vastly different backgrounds. They each speak their own (body) language, each have their own ethnicity, nationality, and culture.

        The title of the performance is a quote from civil rights activist James Baldwin: "While in battle I’m free, never free to rest." Is life a fight for life and death? Or a powerful dance party if only we set our bodies free?<br><br>
        For the uncompromising choreographer Sharifi, art is always political. In a time of conflict, where groups clash, fight, and go to war, he presents a masterpiece about the transformative power of the collective. It shows how new possibilities arise from our differences if we make room for them. It reflects on how we all struggle to be free in the world – together, but with our own voices.
